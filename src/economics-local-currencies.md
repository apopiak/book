# Local Currencies

Cryptocurrencies are fundamentally global in nature. Their networks are decentralized and don't care for national borders. But global currencies have a severe disadvantage: Their purchase value can evolve very differently in different regions. The Euro is such an example that is the official currency in many european countires with distinct fiscal policies and economic development. While there are political reasons to favor such a unifying currency, many economists doubt the concept. States with less economic growth have no option of devaluing their national currency. They can only get into debt - and then get forced into austerity, further weakening their economy.

Local currencies on the other hand are mainly affected by local economy.
